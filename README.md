## Power BI Dashboard: Design & Interactive Strategy

Design a high-performance, interactive dashboard that empowers business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions regarding sales performance and operational efficiency.

## Interactive Features & Visual Logic
To satisfy the core business requirements, the dashboard was built with a focus on usability and clarity:

**Strategic KPI Selection:** Prioritized **Total Sales**, **Net Profit**, and **Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth** to provide an immediate snapshot of organizational health.
**Dynamic Interactivity:** Integrated **Slicers and Filters** (Region, Product Category, and Status) allowing stakeholders to customize their view and perform granular deep-dives.
**Time-Series Analysis:** Developed a dedicated temporal view to track performance trends over months and quarters, identifying seasonal peaks and valleys.
**Summary Cards:** Implemented high-visibility **Data Cards** for totals, ensuring that the most critical numbers are never more than a glance away.

### 🎨 Visual Identity & Tools
* **Tools Used:** Power BI 
* **Design Principle:** Applied a Consistent Color Theme and clean layout to reduce cognitive load and ensure a professional aesthetic.
* **Data Modeling:** Optimized the underlying data schema to ensure real-time filter responsiveness and accurate DAX calculations.

### 📈 Business Objectives Met
